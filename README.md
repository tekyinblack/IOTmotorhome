# IOTmotorhome
This is a set of routines to provide an Internet of Things within a motorhome, motor caravan or mobile home environment, depending on how you want to call a living accomodation mounted on a chassis with and engine :)
They may also be adaptable for other environments, but the main thrust is for 12V operated systems.
